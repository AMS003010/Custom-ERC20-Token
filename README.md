# Create Your Custom ERC20 Token

This project demonstrates the process to create your very own custom ERC20 Tokens using the HardHat Framework. Here, the project will be built on the Ethereum Network ( more precisely the SEPOLIA TEST NETWORK ).

Here I have used Alchemy as the node provider.


To deploy the contract for token creation, run:

```
main.js
```

To interact with the deployed contract, run:

```
interact.js
```
# Required modules:

- @openzeppelin
- @nomicfoundation
